## How to Contribute

* On a team, you start with `git pull` or `git pull --rebase`
* If you've made changes to an existing file, do `git add --p`, which will go by "chunk" of the file
* If you've added a new file, do `git add <filename>`
* Then do either `git commit`, which will open an editor, or `git commit -m <commit message>`. In the editor, you should have one line with the short subject, then a description of your changes. Each commit should be focused on one thing as opposed to multiple things
* Then do `git push origin <branch name>`, most likely `<branch name>` will be `master`
